					To the Bride: 
          Likewise I ask you, woman, the man whom God entrusts to you, as loving and honoring your husband and marriage to him according to God's commandment and promise 
		  lead in good and in bad days, until death separates you, then answer: (in Global chat)

          I want to go where you go; where you stay, that's where I stay. Your people are my people, and your God is my God. <br><br>
          <br><br>
          With these words testifies the Holy Scripture, that marriage is a good gift of God. Your marriage also wants to protect and bless God.
